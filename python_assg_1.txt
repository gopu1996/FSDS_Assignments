Answer 1: In the below elements these are values or an expresion as follow:
         
       *        : expresion
       'hello'  : values
       -87.8    : values
       -        : expresion
       /        : expresion
       +	    : expresion
       6        : values

Answer 2: Different between String and variable as follow:
    
          string : it is type of information which we want store in Variable i.e : "Hello"
          Variable :  it store a any type information either it's string,int,float,bool etc

Answer 3 : the three data types are follow:
    
           int : it is used to represent numbers in Python  i.e : value = 10
           String : it is used for representing characters  i.e : value = 'gopal'
           float : it is used for representing numbers in  either positive or negative decimal values i.e: value = 29.9

Answer 4: An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.
          An expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operator.
          i.e : Constant Expressions: These are the expressions that have constant values only
                x = 10 + 2

Answer 5 : An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.
           A statement is an instruction that a Python interpreter can execute. So, in simple words, we can say anything written in Python is a statement
           Note that expressions are statements as well

Answer 6 : bacon = 22

Answer 7 : if we print these two term we get same result
            print('spam' + 'spamspam')  : OP : spamspamspam
            print('spam' * 3) : OP :spamspamspam

Answer 8: There is some rule and regulation of declearing a variable
          egg is valid variable because it's start with letter(a-zA-Z) or underscore (_).
          100 is not valid because it isn't start with letter(a-zA-Z) or underscore (_).

Answer 9 : The three functions can be used to get the of value are follow:
           
            integer : int()
            float   : float()
            string  : str()

Answer 10: This expression cause an because we are concatenate intger with string.
            fix : 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
                  'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'

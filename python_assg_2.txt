Answer 4: 		                                      Output	 
			(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                      False
			 not (5 > 4)                              False
			(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                       True
			not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))                 False

Answer 5 : Python has six comparison operators, which are as follows:
				Less than ( < )
				Less than or equal to (<=)
				Greater than (>)
				Greater than or equal to (>=)
				Equal to ( == )
				Not equal to ( != )		

Answer 6: The "=" is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.
          The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true		
          
		  When ever we want assigning the value to a variable then we are use the assignment operator.  ie: x = 10 ; print(x) ; opt : 10
		  When ever we have to checks whether the two given operands are equal or not then we are using  '==' i.e: x , y = 10  ; print(x == y); opt : True
		  
Answer 7 :  The Three block are 
				print('eggs')
				if spam > 5:
					print('bacon')
				else:
					print('ham')
				print('spam')	

Answer 8: The Code as follows:
			spam = int(input('Enter the Number'))
			if spam == 1:
				print("Hello")
			elif spam == 2 :
				print("Howdy")
			else:
				print("Greetings!")
				
Answer 9: Ctrl + C .

Answer 10:                          BREAK                                                     CONTINUE
                        
						The 'break 'stop the loop.                                      The 'continue' does not stop the loop and it stops the current.
							
             It eliminates the execution of remaining iteration of loop                 It will terminate only the current iteration of loop.
			 Syntax: break                                                                           Syntax : continue
			
			
Answer 11: range(10)	: in this method we provide only stop arguments for loop
           range(0,10)	: in this method we provide start and stop arguments for loop		
		   range(0,10,1): in this method we provide start,stop and step arguments for loop
		   
		   
Answer 12:	For loop :
			   for i in range(1,10):
				print(i)
		    While loop:
                i = 1
				while i <=10 :
					print(i)
					i +=1 	

Answer 13: This function can be called with spam.bacon().
